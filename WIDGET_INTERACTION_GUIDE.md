# Widget Interaction Flow

This document describes the new widget interaction flow that allows users to seamlessly transition from the main AI Business Assistant to specialized workflow-based planning tools.

## How It Works

### 1. Main Dashboard Interaction
- Users start by chatting with the AI Business Assistant on the main dashboard
- The assistant analyzes user messages for business planning or finance-related keywords
- After relevant conversations, a widget recommendation popup appears

### 2. Widget Recommendation System
The system automatically detects when to recommend widgets based on:

**Business Planning Keywords:**
- business plan, strategy, market analysis, competition, target market
- business model, mission, vision, swot, competitive advantage

**Finance & Funding Keywords:**
- funding, investment, loan, capital, financial projection, budget
- cash flow, revenue, profit, expenses, startup costs, venture capital

### 3. Workflow-Based Widget Pages
Each widget page now contains a comprehensive workflow interface with:
- **Step-by-step progress tracking** with visual indicators
- **Structured form-based questions** for systematic data collection
- **AI Assistant sidebar** for contextual help and guidance
- **Resource library** with calculators, benchmarks, and tutorials
- **Progress summary** showing completion status and time spent
- **Save/resume functionality** for long-form planning sessions
